# openhab_installation_script
Installation script for openhab 1 for z-wave GPIO to raspberry pi

WORK IN PROGRESS!

Using raspian - but NOOBS, Ubuntu etc should work too.
Link to Raspian: https://www.raspbian.org/RaspbianImages

The script is taking bits from the following tutorial:

- Important files with their location:
OpenHAB configuration: /etc/openhab/configurations
To add new layouts, create a new file called eg. home.sitemap under the sitemaps folder.
To register new devices, add a new file called eg. home.items under the items folder.
There should be a demo file in each folder as an example how to set up the configurations.
